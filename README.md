- 👋 Hi, I’m @AbsurdePhoton
- 👀 I’m interested in photography and tools that help producing/enhancing/transforming photographs
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything that can have an utility in computer vision applied to photography - I have learned and investigated a lot these last years about color spaces, 3D, machine learning, etc
- 💞️ Maybe I could collaborate to interesting projects linked with my own interests, why not?
- 📫 How to reach me: the contact page of my site www.absurdephoton.fr
